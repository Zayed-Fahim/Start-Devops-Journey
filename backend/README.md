I started learning Devops Engineering. Motivate to learn Devops because of high paying salary.

If I want to express myself as a expertise of Devops or better than other devops engineer then I have to fullfil some prerequisite:

   1.Have to know very well about Backend Engeneering(e.g. websocket, micro services and so on).
   2.Have to good knowledge about System Design Architecture.
   3.Have to be good at Devops Operations(e.g. Docker, Nginx, aws, git, github, CI/CD and so on).
